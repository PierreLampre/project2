            <div class="explanation">
                <b>How it Applies: </b>Renovation Costs are a one time, upfront cost. They are added to the purchase
                price (along with any closing costs) to determine the initial investment. As the renovation costs only
                happen once, they do not affect the Net Yearly Rent. </div>

            <br>
            <div class="explanation">
                Initial Investment = (Purchase Price + Renovation Costs + [any other initial costs]) <br>
                Yearly Rent - (recurring costs) = Net Yearly Rent <br>
                Net Yearly Rent/Initial Investment = Yield

        <div class="card-body border border-dark">
            <div class="explanation">
                <b>Tips: </b> Not all investments require renovation costs. If the property is already in good
                condition, the renovation costs may be zero. Also, often buyers will receive a credit towards
                maintenance repairs as part of the agreement of sale (depending on the nature of the transaction). If
                you aren't sure of the potential renovation costs, leave it as zero. </div>
