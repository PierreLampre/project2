            <div class="explanation">
                <b>How it Applies: </b>Insurance is a yearly recurring cost, so it is subtracted from the Yearly Rent (along with any other recurring costs) to determine Net Yearly Rent.</div>

            <br>
            <div class="explanation">
                Initial Investment = (Purchase Price + Renovation Costs + [any other initial costs]) <br>
                Yearly Rent - (recurring costs) = Net Yearly Rent <br>
                Net Yearly Rent/Initial Investment = Yield

                <b>Tips: </b> While insurance isn't technically required, most investments are insured (and if you intend to use a mortgage to purchase the property, you will be required to have insurance). If
                you aren't sure of the potential insurance costs, use .0025% of the property. For example, if the Projected Purchase price is $400,000, expect insurance to cost somewhere around $1,250. However, many factors can affect your actual rate, such as location, residential/commercial, nature of the investment, etc.</div>
