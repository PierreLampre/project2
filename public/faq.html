                    <b>Tips:</b> While insurance isn't technically required, most investments are insured (and if you
                    intend
                    to use a mortgage to purchase the property, you will be required to have insurance). If you aren't
                    sure
                    of the potential insurance costs, use .0025% of the property. For example, if the Projected Purchase
                    price is $400,000, expect insurance to cost somewhere around $1,250. However, many factors can
                    affect
                    your actual rate, such as location, residential/commercial, nature of the investment, etc.

                    Initial Investment = (Purchase Price + Renovation Costs + Closing Costs)

                    Closing Costs typically consist primarily of:
                    Transfer Taxes (which depend on the local rate)
                    Any mortgage fees such as origination costs
                    Title Insurance/Fees

                    <b>Tips:</b>Closing costs depend on the nature of the transaction. If the purchase is unleveraged
                    (meaning there is no mortgage involved), the closing costs should be significantly reduced. Also,the
                    transfer tax (which is completely separate from the yearly property tax) is likely to be the largest
                    of
                    the closing costs, so determining the local transfer tax rate is a good place to start when
                    determining
                    the projected closing costs. If you aren't sure of the potential closing costs, use 3% of the total
                    purchase price.
