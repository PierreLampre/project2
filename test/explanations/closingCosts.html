                <b>Definition:</b> The extra costs associated with purchasing the Property, such as transfer tax,
                mortgage fees, title fees,etc. They are essentially all the one time costs that aren't accounted for the
                Purchase Price and the Renovation Costs.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body border border-dark">
            <div class="explanation">
                <b>How it Applies: </b>Closing costs are a one time cost, so they apply to the initial investment (as
                opposed to reoccuring costs, which apply to the Yearly Rent). The closing costs are combined with the
                Purchase Price and the Renovation Cost, collectively making up the Initial Investment. </div>
            <br>
            <div class="explanation">
                Initial Investment = (Purchase Price + Renovation Costs + Closing Costs) <br><br>
                Closing Costs typically consist primarily of:
                <ul>
                    <li>Transfer Taxes (which depend on the local rate)</li>
                    <li>Any mortgage fees such as origination costs</li>
                    <li>Title Insurance/Fees</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body border border-dark">
            <div class="explanation">
                <b>Tips: </b> Closing costs depend on the nature of the transaction. If the purchase is unleveraged
                (meaning there is no mortgage involved), the closing costs should be significantly reduced. Also, the
                transfer tax (which is completely separate from the yearly property tax) is likely to be the largest of
                the closing costs, so determining the local transfer tax rate is a good place to start when determining
                the projected closing costs.<br><br>
                If you aren't sure of the potential closing costs, use 3% of the total purchase price.
