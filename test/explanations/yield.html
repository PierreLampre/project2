                <b>Definition:</b> Yield is another word for the rate of return. It represents the percentage of the
                investment returned each year. If you purchase a property for $100 and it returns $5 in year one, it has
                a yield of 5%.</div>

                <b>How it Applies: </b>Yield is our end goal. Net Yearly Rent (which is Yearly Rent - recurring costs)
                divided by Initial Investment gives us Yield. It is expressed in the form of a percentage. Yield is
                essentially the relationship between the rent and the purchase price when accounting for all of the
                costs associated with the property.</div>

                Net Yearly Rent/Initial Investment = Yield

                <b>Tips: </b> Your goal should be to create as high of a Yield as possible on your investment, however
                not all Yield is the same. A larger investment with a lower Yield may result in a larger financial
                return than a smaller investment with a higher yield.

                While Property 2 has the largest Yield, it actually returns the least money, because the Initial
                Investment was so much lower. In sum, be sure to compare the Yield to the Initial Investment when
                determining your strategy.
